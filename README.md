# Python-Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Applied Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook that will interact with the file.
## About Me

My data science competencies include:
- Computer Applications
- Managing Projects through GitHub
- Python Programming
- Data Wrangling

In order to test the inclusion of a photograph, I've included a photo of Franconia Ridge in New Hampshire. I took the photo with my iPhone 12 Pro Max during my Appalachian Trail thru-hike:
